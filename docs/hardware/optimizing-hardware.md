## Repaste the Cooler

- [Grizzly Kryonaut](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/products/16-kryonaut-en) is commonly recommended. You may also look into other brands such as Noctua or Arctic.
- [Grizzly Conductonaut](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/produkte/25-conductonaut) is a higher performant option (being liquid metal) at the risk of killing the machine if improperly applied.
