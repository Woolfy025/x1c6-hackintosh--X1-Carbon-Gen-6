## Repaste the Cooler

- [Grizzly Kryonaut](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/products/16-kryonaut-en) is commonly recommended. You may also look into other brands such as Noctua or Arctic.
- [Grizzly Conductonaut](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/produkte/25-conductonaut) is a higher performant option (being liquid metal) at the risk of killing the machine if improperly applied. 

## Replace the Fan (if applicable)

## Battery Replacement

- Depending on the battery health (cycle count, max capacity), consider getting a battery replacement. See [Lenovo Part 01AV494](https://lenovo.encompass.com/item/11537594/Lenovo/01AV494/). Avoid battery replacements from eBay as their autheticity cannot be verified.
