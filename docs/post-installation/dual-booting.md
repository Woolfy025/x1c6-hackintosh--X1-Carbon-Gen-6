- I recommend that you dual boot using another drive in the WAN slot (I have the WDC PC SN520 NVMe 2242). This makes installation much easier, and lets the BIOS F12 option act as your boot manager.
- I've found that dual booting with OpenCore on a single can be quite troublesome. Instead, what I recommend is to use rEFInd Boot Manager should you need to dual boot Windows or Linux.
- It is possible to share Bluetooth pairing keys between Windows and macOS when dual booting. 
  - The `.reg` for Bluetooth connected devices in macOS can be exported using Hackintool's Utilities section. This key can then be imported to Windows.
