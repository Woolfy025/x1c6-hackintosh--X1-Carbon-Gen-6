    MultiMedia Fn keys will work out of the box. Special Fn keys require [YogaSMC App](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC) to be installed. Additionally, some parameters can be configured with YogaSMC's PrefPane plugin.

- PrtSc (remapped to F13) = I use it for Screen Capture (Set in `System Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts`)
- Check `Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys` in `System Preferences/Keyboard` to gain access to standard F keys:
